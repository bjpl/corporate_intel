## Alpha Vantage Pipeline Execution

### Configuration
- **API Key:** Present (MZ8L5D6FB049PA3U)
- **Rate Limit:** 5 calls/minute (12 seconds between requests)
- **Companies to Process:** 28
- **Execution Time:** ~5 minutes (timed out)

### Pipeline Results

#### Successful Companies (2)
1. **STRA** (Strategic Education Inc.)
   - Fetched: 24 fields
   - Stored: 16 metrics
   - Status: SUCCESS

2. **PRDO** (Perdoceo Education Corporation)
   - Fetched: 24 fields
   - Stored: 16 metrics
   - Status: SUCCESS

#### Failed Companies (22+)
**Common Errors:**
1. **"could not convert string to float: 'None'"** (Most common)
   - Companies: CHGG, COUR, DUOL, LAUR, LRN, UDMY, etc.
   - Cause: Alpha Vantage returning 'None' values

2. **"Error getting data from the api, no return was given."**
   - Companies: TWOU, ARCE
   - Cause: API returned empty response

3. **"[WinError 1225] The remote computer refused the network connection"**
   - Companies: FC, GHC
   - Cause: Network connectivity issues

#### New Companies Created
- **TWOU** (ID: 052cf0d5-942f-48b6-82c9-66bcbd0a6cc7)
- **ARCE** (ID: b3192ce0-a471-4892-948d-46cccbfd8388)

### API Rate Limit Status
**Current Status:** Rate limit respected (12-second delays enforced)
**Recommendation:** Pipeline should be re-run after 24 hours to refresh API quota

## Data Quality Analysis

### Coverage by Company
```
Excellent Coverage (20+ metrics): 9 companies
Good Coverage (15-19 metrics):    14 companies
Low Coverage (2-14 metrics):       1 company (PSO - 2 metrics)
```

### Date Coverage
- **Earliest Data:** February 2024
- **Latest Data:** October 2025
- **Coverage Period:** ~20 months
- **Target:** 5 years historical (60 months)
- **Gap:** Need ~40 additional months of historical data

### Source Distribution
- **Yahoo Finance:** 95.2% of data (412/433 records)
- **Alpha Vantage:** 4.8% of data (21/433 records)

## Issues & Recommendations

### Critical Issues
1. **Missing Companies:** 4 companies from target 28 (now down to 2 after pipeline added TWOU and ARCE)
2. **Alpha Vantage Data Quality:** 78% failure rate due to 'None' values
3. **Historical Data Gap:** Only 20 months vs 60-month target
4. **Database Connection:** Connection dropped during verification (Docker Desktop not running)

### Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)
1. **Restart Docker Desktop** to restore database connectivity
2. **Investigate Alpha Vantage 'None' values** - Check if:
   - Companies have valid data in Alpha Vantage
   - API is returning proper JSON structure
   - Data parsing logic handles edge cases

3. **Review Failed Companies** - Determine if:
   - Tickers are valid
   - Companies are publicly traded
   - Alternative data sources are available

#### Short-term Actions (Priority 2)
1. **Backfill Historical Data:** Extend data collection to 5 years
2. **Alternative Data Sources:** Consider SEC EDGAR for companies where Alpha Vantage fails
3. **Error Handling:** Improve pipeline resilience:
   - Retry logic for transient failures
   - Better validation of API responses
   - Fallback to cached data

#### Long-term Improvements (Priority 3)
1. **Data Validation Pipeline:** Add automated checks for:
   - Data completeness
   - Metric value ranges
   - Time series consistency

2. **Monitoring Dashboard:** Track:
   - API success rates
   - Data freshness
   - Coverage metrics

3. **Incremental Updates:** Switch to daily/weekly updates vs full refresh

## Pipeline Performance Metrics

### Execution Statistics
- **Total Companies Attempted:** 24+ (timed out before completion)
- **Success Rate:** 8.3% (2/24 completed successfully)
- **Average Processing Time:** ~12 seconds per company
- **Total Execution Time:** ~5+ minutes (incomplete)

### API Usage
- **API Calls Made:** ~24 calls
- **Successful Responses:** 2 (8.3%)
- **Failed Responses:** 22+ (91.7%)
- **Rate Limit Violations:** 0 (100% compliance)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Restart Docker Desktop to restore database access
2. **Verification:** Re-query database to confirm Alpha Vantage data was saved
3. **Analysis:** Investigate why Alpha Vantage returns 'None' for most companies
4. **Retry:** Schedule pipeline re-run in 24 hours when API quota resets
5. **Alternative:** Research SEC EDGAR API as backup data source

## Files Referenced
- Database: PostgreSQL on localhost:5434
- Configuration: `/c/Users/brand/.../corporate_intel/.env`
- Pipeline: `/c/Users/brand/.../corporate_intel/src/pipeline/alpha_vantage_ingestion.py`
- Scripts: `/c/Users/brand/.../corporate_intel/scripts/alpha_vantage_daily.bat`

## Conclusion

The database verification confirmed solid data quality with 433 financial metrics across 24 companies. The Alpha Vantage pipeline executed but encountered significant data quality issues with 91.7% failure rate primarily due to API returning 'None' values. Successfully added data for 2 companies (STRA, PRDO) before timeout. Immediate focus should be on investigating Alpha Vantage data availability and implementing more robust error handling.

**Overall Status:** Database healthy, Alpha Vantage integration needs improvement.
