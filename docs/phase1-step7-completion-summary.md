## Version Constraint Highlights

### Core Framework (Production-Critical)
```python
fastapi>=0.104.0,<1.0.0           # Stable API, breaking changes in 1.0
pydantic>=2.5.0,<3.0.0            # Major v2 rewrite, next breaking in 3.0
sqlalchemy>=2.0.0,<3.0.0          # Industry-standard ORM
uvicorn[standard]>=0.24.0,<1.0.0  # ASGI server with WebSocket support
```

### Data Processing
```python
pandas>=2.1.0,<3.0.0              # Apache Arrow backend
numpy>=1.24.0,<2.0.0              # NumPy 2.0 has breaking changes
dbt-core>=1.7.0,<2.0.0            # Data transformation stability
```

### High-Risk Dependencies (Require Monitoring)
```python
yfinance>=0.2.33,<1.0.0                              # External API, frequent changes
great-expectations>=0.18.0,<1.0.0                    # Pre-1.0, evolving API
opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi>=0.42b0,<1.0.0 # Beta package
```

### Pre-1.0 But Stable
```python
asyncpg>=0.29.0,<1.0.0            # Mature PostgreSQL driver
httpx>=0.25.0,<1.0.0              # HTTP client for testing
ruff>=0.1.0,<1.0.0                # Fast linter, rapid development
```

## Files Updated

### ✅ Completed
- **/mnt/c/Users/brand/Development/Project_Workspace/active-development/corporate_intel/requirements.txt**
  - All 42 core dependencies with proper version constraints
  - Format: `package>=X.Y.Z,<(X+1).0.0`

### ⏳ Pending (for other agents)
- requirements-dev.txt - Needs constraint update (16 packages)
- pyproject.toml - Needs constraint update (dependencies section)

## Key Decisions & Rationale

### 1. Semantic Versioning Strategy
- **Stable packages (≥1.0.0)**: Cap at next major version `<(X+1).0.0`
- **Pre-1.0 packages**: Conservative bounds, typically `<1.0.0`
- **Beta packages**: Explicit monitoring with `<1.0.0` cap

### 2. Special Cases

#### yfinance: Changed to `<1.0.0`
- Initially considered `<0.3.0` (minor version cap)
- Changed to `<1.0.0` after review for more flexibility
- External API dependency requires careful monitoring
- Rationale: Balance between stability and updates

#### NumPy: Strict `<2.0.0` Cap
- NumPy 2.0 introduces breaking changes
- Many dependencies not yet compatible
- Critical for data processing stability
- Will require coordinated upgrade across ecosystem

#### Pydantic: Major Version Alignment
- Pydantic 2.x represents complete rewrite
- pydantic-settings aligned to same major version
- Breaking changes expected in 3.0
- Core validation logic requires stability

### 3. Risk Mitigation Strategy
- **High-risk packages**: Monthly changelog review
- **Pre-1.0 packages**: Track issue boards for breaking changes
- **External APIs**: Implement adapter pattern for isolation
- **Beta packages**: Consider stable alternatives
