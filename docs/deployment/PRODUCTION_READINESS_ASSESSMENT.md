## Risk Analysis

### Critical Risks (P0) - None ✅

**Status**: Zero critical risks identified that would prevent production deployment.

### High Risks (P1) - 1 Item (Non-Blocking)

#### Risk #1: Prometheus Staging Container
- **Description**: Container exited with error code 127 in staging environment
- **Probability**: N/A (already occurred in staging)
- **Impact**: Medium (metrics collection unavailable in staging)
- **Mitigation**: Production has fresh Prometheus configuration
- **Workaround**: Rebuild container before Day 4 staging validation
- **Resolution Time**: 30 minutes
- **Blocking Production**: **No** (isolated to staging environment)

**Action Plan**:
1. Review Prometheus container logs for error details
2. Rebuild container: `docker-compose up -d --force-recreate prometheus`
3. Validate metrics collection and alert rules
4. Test alertmanager notifications

### Medium Risks (P2) - 4 Items (All Low Impact)

#### Risk #2: Initial Data Ingestion Failure
- **Description**: First-time data ingestion from external APIs may fail
- **Probability**: Medium (API keys, rate limits, network issues)
- **Impact**: Medium (delayed pipeline activation, not critical for deployment)
- **Mitigation**: Test all API keys and credentials before Day 4 execution
- **Fallback**: Manual data load from backup sources or retry with adjusted rate limits
- **Resolution Time**: 1-2 hours (troubleshooting and configuration)

#### Risk #3: Workflow Scheduling Issues
- **Description**: Prefect workflows may not schedule correctly on first run
- **Probability**: Low (tested in development, not in production environment)
- **Impact**: Low (manual workflow triggering available)
- **Mitigation**: Test Prefect workflows in staging environment first
- **Fallback**: Manual workflow execution until scheduling resolved
- **Resolution Time**: 1 hour (configuration adjustment)

#### Risk #4: Database Performance Under Load
- **Description**: Production load may exceed staging baseline
- **Probability**: Low (Day 1 baseline shows 65% CPU, 75% memory headroom)
- **Impact**: Low (performance degradation, not failure)
- **Mitigation**: Database dashboard alerts configured for early warning
- **Fallback**: Connection pool tuning, query optimization
- **Resolution Time**: 2-4 hours (tuning and testing)

#### Risk #5: SSL Certificate Renewal Failure
- **Description**: Let's Encrypt auto-renewal may fail
- **Probability**: Very Low (auto-renewal tested, 90 days validity remaining)
- **Impact**: High if occurs (HTTPS unavailable)
- **Mitigation**: Certificate expiry alerts configured (30-day warning)
- **Fallback**: Manual certificate renewal procedure documented
- **Resolution Time**: 15 minutes (manual renewal)

### Low Risks (P3) - 2 Items (Minimal Impact)

#### Risk #6: Monitoring Alert Noise
- **Description**: Alert rules may trigger false positives
- **Probability**: Medium (new production environment)
- **Impact**: Very Low (alert fatigue, can be tuned)
- **Mitigation**: Alert thresholds based on staging baseline
- **Fallback**: Tune alert thresholds based on production data
- **Resolution Time**: 1 week (gradual tuning)

#### Risk #7: Backup Storage Capacity
- **Description**: Backup storage may fill up faster than expected
- **Probability**: Low (retention policy configured for 12 months)
- **Impact**: Very Low (automated cleanup, monitoring in place)
- **Mitigation**: Hourly backup monitoring with disk usage alerts
- **Fallback**: Increase retention policy aggressiveness
- **Resolution Time**: 1 hour (configuration change)

### Risk Summary

| Risk Level | Count | Blocking Production | Mitigation Status |
|------------|-------|---------------------|-------------------|
| P0 (Critical) | 0 | No | N/A |
| P1 (High) | 1 | No | Mitigated |
