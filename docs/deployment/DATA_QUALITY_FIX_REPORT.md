# Data Quality Fix Report - Duplicate Company Records

**Date**: October 17, 2025
**Issue**: Duplicate company records created during SEC ingestion
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
**Swarm Session**: Day 4 Post-Completion Cleanup

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully resolved a critical data quality issue where SEC filings were stored in duplicate "Company CIK" records instead of linking to existing properly-named company records. This prevented analytics from connecting SEC filings with financial metrics from other data sources.

### Impact Before Fix:
- ❌ 32 total companies (24 proper + 8 duplicates)
- ❌ 80 SEC filings linked to wrong companies
- ❌ Analytics couldn't correlate SEC data with financial metrics
- ❌ No CIK values in proper company records

### Impact After Fix:
- ✅ 24 total companies (0 duplicates)
- ✅ 80 SEC filings properly linked to correct companies
- ✅ Analytics can now correlate all data sources
- ✅ All companies with filings have proper CIK values

---

## The Problem

### Root Cause:
The SEC ingestion script (`src/pipeline/sec_ingestion.py`) created new company records with placeholder names like "Company CIK 0001364954" instead of:
1. Looking up existing companies by CIK
2. Using proper company names from SEC ticker mappings
3. Linking filings to existing company records

### Specific Issues:
1. **Duplicate Companies Created**:
   - Chegg Inc. (CHGG) existed with financial metrics
   - "Company CIK 0001364954" created with SEC filings
   - These should be ONE company, not two

2. **Data Disconnection**:
   - Alpha Vantage metrics → Linked to "Chegg Inc."
   - SEC filings → Linked to "Company CIK 0001364954"
   - Analytics queries couldn't join the data

3. **Missing CIK Values**:
   - Proper companies lacked CIK identifiers
   - Future ingestion would create more duplicates

---

## The Solution

### Phase 1: Immediate Data Cleanup ✅

**Script**: `scripts/data-cleanup/fix-duplicates.sql`

**Actions Taken**:
1. Mapped 8 CIK numbers to proper ticker symbols using SEC official data
2. Reassigned all 80 SEC filings to proper company records
3. Deleted 8 duplicate "Company CIK" records
4. Updated proper companies with CIK values

**Mappings Applied**:
| CIK        | Duplicate Name         | Proper Company                    | Filings |
|------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------|
| 0001364954 | Company CIK 0001364954 | Chegg Inc. (CHGG)                | 10      |
| 0001157408 | Company CIK 0001157408 | Chegg Inc. (CHGG)                | 10      |
| 0001651562 | Company CIK 0001651562 | Coursera Inc. (COUR)             | 10      |
| 0001607939 | Company CIK 0001607939 | Coursera Inc. (COUR)             | 10      |
| 0001562088 | Company CIK 0001562088 | Duolingo Inc. (DUOL)             | 10      |
| 0000730464 | Company CIK 0000730464 | Stride Inc. (LRN)                | 10      |
| 0001434588 | Company CIK 0001434588 | Perdoceo Education Corp. (PRDO)  | 10      |
| 0001013934 | Company CIK 0001013934 | Strategic Education Inc. (STRA)  | 10      |

**Note**: Chegg and Coursera each had 2 CIK numbers, so their filings were merged (20 each).

### Phase 2: Prevention Code Fix ✅

**File Modified**: `src/pipeline/sec_ingestion.py`

**New Function**: `get_or_create_company()` (lines 467-559)

**Strategy Implemented**:
1. **Lookup by CIK** (primary) - Most reliable identifier
2. **Lookup by Ticker** (secondary) - Uses SEC mappings
3. **Create with proper name** (fallback) - Fetches real name from SEC API

**Code Snippet**:
```python
async def get_or_create_company(session, cik: str, filing_data: Dict) -> Company:
    """
    Get or create company with three-tier lookup strategy.
    Prevents duplicate 'Company CIK' records.
    """
    # Try lookup by CIK first
    result = await session.execute(
        select(Company).where(Company.cik == cik)
    )
    company = result.scalar_one_or_none()

    if company:
        logger.info(f"Found existing company by CIK: {company.name}")
        return company

    # Try reverse lookup: ticker -> CIK -> company
    ticker = get_ticker_from_cik_mapping(cik)
    if ticker:
        result = await session.execute(
            select(Company).where(Company.ticker == ticker)
        )
        company = result.scalar_one_or_none()

        if company:
            # Update with CIK for future lookups
            company.cik = cik
            logger.info(f"Found company by ticker, updated CIK: {company.name}")
            return company

    # Create new with proper name from SEC
    company_name = await fetch_company_name_from_sec(cik)
    company = Company(
        name=company_name,  # Real name, not "Company CIK..."
        cik=cik,
        ticker=ticker or cik
    )
    session.add(company)
    logger.info(f"Created new company: {company_name} (CIK: {cik})")
    return company
```

### Phase 3: Documentation & Testing ✅

**Files Created**:
- `docs/pipeline/sec_company_deduplication.md` - Technical documentation
- `docs/pipeline/CHANGES_SEC_DEDUPLICATION.md` - Change summary
- `tests/test_sec_company_lookup.py` - Comprehensive test suite (5 tests)
- `scripts/data-ingestion/cleanup_duplicate_companies.py` - Future cleanup utility

## Validation Results

### Before Fix:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN name LIKE 'Company CIK %' THEN 1 END) as duplicates
FROM companies;
-- total: 32, duplicates: 8
```

### After Fix:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN name LIKE 'Company CIK %' THEN 1 END) as duplicates
FROM companies;
-- total: 24, duplicates: 0 ✅
```

### Filing Distribution:
```
 ticker |              name              |    cik     | filing_count
--------+--------------------------------+------------+--------------
 CHGG   | Chegg Inc.                     | 0001364954 |           20
 COUR   | Coursera Inc.                  | 0001651562 |           20

3. No validation to prevent "Company CIK" placeholder names

### What Went Right:
1. Early detection before production deployment
2. Transaction-safe cleanup with rollback capability
3. Comprehensive prevention code added
4. Zero data loss during cleanup

### Recommendations:
1. ✅ Add data quality checks to ingestion pipelines
2. ✅ Validate company name formats (reject "Company CIK" pattern)
3. ✅ Ensure CIK values populated for all public companies
4. ✅ Add integration tests for multi-source company matching
