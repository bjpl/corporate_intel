## Section 5: Load Testing Strategy

### 5.1 Load Test Configuration

**Load Testing Tool**: Locust (Python-based)

**Test Scenarios**:
1. **API Endpoint Load**
   - Test: All 18 API endpoints
   - Users: 10, 25, 50, 100 concurrent
   - Duration: 5 minutes per level
   - Ramp-up: 30 seconds

2. **Search Heavy Load**
   - Test: Company search endpoint
   - Users: 50 concurrent
   - Duration: 10 minutes
   - Pattern: 80% search, 20% details

3. **Data Pipeline Load**
   - Test: Concurrent data ingestion
   - Workflows: All 5 Prefect workflows
   - Duration: 30 minutes
   - Pattern: Realistic ingestion rates

**Success Criteria**:
- P99 latency <100ms (50 users), <200ms (100 users)
- Throughput >50 QPS (50 users), >100 QPS (100 users)
- Error rate <0.1%
- No service crashes

### 5.2 Expected Performance

**Based on Day 1 Baseline** (9.2/10 performance):
- Current P99: 32.14ms (no load)
- Expected P99 (50 users): 60-80ms
- Expected P99 (100 users): 120-160ms

**Degradation Factors**:
- Baseline → 50 users: 2-3x latency increase expected
- Baseline → 100 users: 4-5x latency increase expected

**Acceptable Performance**:
- P99 <100ms at 50 users (baseline 32ms → 100ms = 3x degradation)
- P99 <200ms at 100 users (baseline 32ms → 200ms = 6x degradation)

### 5.3 Load Test Execution Plan

**Pre-Test** (15 min):
1. Verify baseline metrics (single user)
2. Clear caches and logs
3. Open monitoring dashboards
4. Notify team of test start

**Test Execution** (1.5 hours):
1. 10 users: 5 minutes (baseline validation)
2. 25 users: 5 minutes (light load)
3. 50 users: 10 minutes (target capacity)
4. 100 users: 10 minutes (stress test)
5. Spike test: 200 users for 2 minutes (resilience)

**Post-Test** (30 min):
1. Collect metrics from Prometheus/Grafana
2. Analyze logs for errors
3. Document bottlenecks
4. Generate load test report

## Section 6: Alert Tuning Guide

### 6.1 Current Alert Rules (42 total)

**API Alerts** (15 rules):
- High latency: P99 >100ms
- High error rate: >1%
- Low success rate: <99%
- High request rate: >1000 QPS

**Database Alerts** (12 rules):
- Slow queries: >100ms
- Connection pool: >80% utilization
- Cache hit ratio: <95%
- Replication lag: >10s

**Redis Alerts** (8 rules):
- Memory usage: >80%
- Evicted keys: >100/min
- Connection failures: >10/min

**System Alerts** (7 rules):
- CPU usage: >70%
- Memory usage: >80%
- Disk usage: >70%
- Disk I/O: >1000 IOPS

### 6.2 Tuning Strategy

**After 24 Hours of Production Metrics**:

1. **Review False Positives**
   - Identify alerts that fired but weren't issues
   - Increase thresholds if noise detected
   - Example: P99 >100ms → >120ms if baseline is 80-90ms

2. **Review Missed Issues**
   - Identify issues not caught by alerts
   - Add new alerts or lower thresholds
   - Example: Add alert for data freshness >6 hours

3. **Tune Sensitivity**
   - Critical alerts: Low threshold (catch early)
   - Warning alerts: Higher threshold (reduce noise)
   - Example: CPU >70% warning, >85% critical

**Goal**: 0 false positives, 100% issue coverage
