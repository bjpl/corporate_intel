## Critical Issues (All Resolved)

### 1. Hardcoded Staging Credentials in `.env.staging`
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Finding:** Production-like credentials were hardcoded in `.env.staging` file:
- PostgreSQL password: `Staging_Pg_Test_2025!`
- Redis password: `Staging_Redis_Test_2025`
- MinIO password: `Staging_MinIO_Test_2025`
- Superset key: `staging_secret_key_for_testing_only`

**Impact:** If this file was committed to version control, these credentials would be exposed to anyone with repository access, enabling unauthorized access to staging infrastructure.

**Remediation:**
- Replaced all credentials with Vault reference placeholders: `REPLACE_WITH_VAULT_SECRET_<service>_<credential>`
- Added security warning header to file
- Updated `.gitignore` to explicitly exclude `.env.staging`

**Files Modified:**
- `/mnt/c/Users/brand/Development/Project_Workspace/active-development/corporate_intel/.env.staging`
- `/mnt/c/Users/brand/Development/Project_Workspace/active-development/corporate_intel/.gitignore`

---

### 2. Exposed JWT Token in Development `.env`
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Finding:** A complete Flow-Nexus session JWT token was stored in the `.env` file (line 88), including:
- Access token with user email (brandon.lambert87@gmail.com)
- User ID and metadata
- Refresh token
- Session details

**Impact:** Anyone with access to the `.env` file could hijack the user session, impersonate the user, and access Flow-Nexus services with full permissions.

**Remediation:**
- Removed entire JWT token from `.env`
- Replaced with security warning comment
- Documented proper authentication flow using `flow-nexus login` command

**Files Modified:**
- `/mnt/c/Users/brand/Development/Project_Workspace/active-development/corporate_intel/.env`

---

### 3. Hardcoded Development Credentials
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Finding:** Development `.env` file contained actual passwords:
- PostgreSQL: `CI_Pg$tr0ng_P@ssw0rd_2025!`
- Redis: `R3d!s_C@ch3_$ecur3_2025`
- MinIO: `M!n10_0bj3ct_St0r@g3_2025`
- Superset: `xKs9mPfZ3QqR7wL2nV8bC5hJ6tY4aE1gD0iU9oX3sA7fN2kM5vB8`
- Grafana: `Gr@f@n@_V!z_Admin_2025`
- JWT: `JWT_$3cr3t_K3y_F0r_Auth_2025!`

**Impact:** Even in development, hardcoded credentials create security risks and bad practices that can leak into production.

**Remediation:**
- Replaced all credentials with placeholder values
- Standardized placeholder format: `REPLACE_WITH_SECURE_<SERVICE>_<TYPE>`
- Added generation instructions in comments

**Files Modified:**
- `/mnt/c/Users/brand/Development/Project_Workspace/active-development/corporate_intel/.env`

---

### 4. Missing Environment Files from `.gitignore`
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Finding:** While `.env` was in `.gitignore`, environment-specific files were not explicitly excluded:
- `.env.staging` ❌ Not in .gitignore
- `.env.production` ❌ Not in .gitignore

**Impact:** Risk of accidentally committing sensitive staging or production credentials to version control.

**Remediation:**
- Added explicit entries for `.env.staging`, `.env.production`, and `.env.development`
- Added security warning comment in `.gitignore`

**Files Modified:**
- `/mnt/c/Users/brand/Development/Project_Workspace/active-development/corporate_intel/.gitignore`

---

## High Severity Issues (All Resolved)

### 5. Lack of Secrets Management Integration
**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Finding:** No documented or implemented secrets management solution for production deployment.

**Impact:** Without proper secrets management, credentials would need to be managed manually, increasing risk of exposure.

**Remediation:**
- Created comprehensive secrets management documentation
- Implemented HashiCorp Vault integration module
- Implemented AWS Secrets Manager integration module
- Documented migration path from `.env` to Vault/AWS Secrets Manager
- Added CLI tools for secrets management

**Files Created:**
- `/mnt/c/Users/brand/Development/Project_Workspace/active-development/corporate_intel/docs/SECRETS_MANAGEMENT.md`
- `/mnt/c/Users/brand/Development/Project_Workspace/active-development/corporate_intel/config/vault_integration.py`
- `/mnt/c/Users/brand/Development/Project_Workspace/active-development/corporate_intel/config/aws_secrets_integration.py`

---

### 6. Missing SSL/TLS Configuration
**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Finding:** No SSL/TLS configuration for production HTTPS deployment.

**Impact:** Unencrypted HTTP traffic exposes sensitive data in transit, including credentials and API responses.

**Remediation:**
- Created production-ready Nginx reverse proxy configuration with:
  - Modern TLS 1.2/1.3 settings (Mozilla Intermediate profile)
  - OCSP stapling
  - Strong cipher suites
  - Security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
  - Rate limiting zones
- Created SSL certificate generation script supporting:
  - Self-signed certificates (development)
  - Let's Encrypt certificates (production)
  - Automated DH parameter generation

**Files Created:**
- `/mnt/c/Users/brand/Development/Project_Workspace/active-development/corporate_intel/config/nginx-ssl.conf`
- `/mnt/c/Users/brand/Development/Project_Workspace/active-development/corporate_intel/scripts/generate_ssl_cert.sh`

---

### 7. Production Environment File Contains Weak Placeholders
**Severity:** HIGH (Potential)
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Finding:** `.env.production` file existed with generic placeholders that could be mistaken for actual values.

**Impact:** Risk of deploying to production with placeholder values, causing application failure or security issues.

**Remediation:**
- Updated placeholders to be explicitly clear (e.g., `CHANGE_ME_USE_STRONG_PASSWORD_FROM_SECRETS_MANAGER`)
- Added clear instructions to use secrets manager
- File is now properly gitignored

**Files Modified:**
- `/mnt/c/Users/brand/Development/Project_Workspace/active-development/corporate_intel/.env.production`

---

## Medium Severity Issues (All Resolved)

### 8. API Rate Limiting Configuration Review
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Finding:** API rate limiting implementation exists in code but needed review and enhancement.

**Current Implementation:**
- Role-based rate limits defined in `src/auth/models.py`:
  - Admin: 10,000 requests/day
  - Analyst: 5,000 requests/day
  - Viewer: 1,000 requests/day
  - Service: 50,000 requests/day
- API key rate limiting: 1,000 requests/hour (configurable per key)

**Enhancements Added:**
- Nginx-level rate limiting configured:
  - Standard API tier: 100 requests/minute with burst of 20
  - Premium API tier: 300 requests/minute (configurable)
  - Zone-based limiting by IP and API key
- 429 status code for rate limit exceeded
- Separate rate limit zones for different API tiers

**Files Modified:**

## Recommendations for Production Deployment

### Immediate Actions (Before Production)

1. **Generate Production Secrets**
   ```bash
   # Generate secure passwords
   openssl rand -base64 32  # For each service password
   openssl rand -hex 32     # For SECRET_KEY
   ```

2. **Set Up Secrets Manager**
   - Choose either HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager
   - Follow setup guide in `/docs/SECRETS_MANAGEMENT.md`
   - Upload all production secrets
   - Test secret retrieval

3. **Configure SSL/TLS**
   ```bash
   # For production with Let's Encrypt
   ./scripts/generate_ssl_cert.sh --type letsencrypt \
     --domain corporate-intel.com \
     --email admin@corporate-intel.com
   ```

4. **Verify .gitignore**
   ```bash
   # Ensure no sensitive files are tracked
   git status --ignored
   git ls-files | grep -E '\.(env|key|pem)'
   ```

5. **Enable Security Headers**
   - Nginx configuration includes all recommended headers
   - Verify HSTS preload after stable operation
   - Test CSP policy with your frontend

### Ongoing Security Practices

1. **Secret Rotation**
   - Rotate all secrets every 90 days minimum
   - Document rotation procedures
   - Test rotation in staging first
   - Use automated rotation where possible (AWS Secrets Manager)

2. **Access Auditing**
   - Enable audit logging in Vault/AWS Secrets Manager
   - Review access logs weekly
   - Alert on unauthorized access attempts
   - Maintain audit trail for compliance

3. **Dependency Security**
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Use Dependabot or Renovate
   - Security scanning in CI/CD
   - Monitor CVE databases

4. **Rate Limit Monitoring**
   - Monitor rate limit hit rates
   - Adjust limits based on legitimate usage patterns
   - Alert on unusual rate limit violations
   - Review API key usage regularly

5. **SSL/TLS Maintenance**
   - Auto-renew Let's Encrypt certificates (certbot handles this)
   - Test certificate renewal: `certbot renew --dry-run`
   - Monitor certificate expiration
   - Update cipher suites annually
