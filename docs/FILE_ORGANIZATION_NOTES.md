# File Organization Completion Notes

## Files Moved

### Documentation Files (moved to /docs)
- `EVALUATION_REPORT.md` -> `/docs/EVALUATION_REPORT.md`
- `DATA_SOURCES_STRATEGY_REPORT.md` -> `/docs/DATA_SOURCES_STRATEGY_REPORT.md`
- `SETUP_GUIDE.md` -> `/docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md`

### Configuration Files (moved to /config)
- `docker-compose.yml` -> `/config/docker-compose.yml`
- `pyproject.toml` -> `/config/pyproject.toml`
- `.mcp.json` -> `/config/.mcp.json`

### Script Files (moved to /scripts)
- `run_ingestion_simple.py` -> `/scripts/run_ingestion_simple.py`

## References Updated

### README.md
- Updated docker-compose command to use `config/docker-compose.yml`
- Updated project structure diagram to show new organization

### Dockerfile
- Updated COPY commands to reference `config/pyproject.toml` and `config/poetry.lock`

## Action Required

### poetry.lock Generation
The `poetry.lock` file needs to be generated. Since poetry is not available in this environment, please run the following command in your development environment:

```bash
cd config/
poetry lock --no-update
```

This will generate the `poetry.lock` file based on the `pyproject.toml` dependencies.

## Import Path Verification

All import paths in the codebase remain valid as only configuration and documentation files were moved, not source code files. The Python source code structure remains unchanged.

## Next Steps

1. Generate `poetry.lock` file using poetry in your local environment
2. Test that docker-compose works with the new path: `docker-compose -f config/docker-compose.yml up -d`
3. Verify all documentation links still work
4. Update any CI/CD pipelines that reference the old file locations
