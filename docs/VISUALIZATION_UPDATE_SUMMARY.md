# Dashboard Visualization Update Summary

## Mission Complete: Replaced Fake Charts with Real Data Visualizations

### What Was Removed (No Data Available)
1. **Retention Curves** - Required cohort data we don't have (MAU/retention data: 0 companies)
2. **Cohort Heatmap** - Required cohort tracking data (not available)
3. **Competitive Landscape Scatter** - Needed YoY growth + NRR (only 5 companies have growth data)

### What Was Added (Using Real Data)

#### 1. Revenue Comparison Bar Chart
- **Data Source**: `companies.revenue` (23 companies)
- **Visualization**: Horizontal bar chart sorted by revenue
- **Features**:
  - Color coded by EdTech category
  - Shows all companies ranked by revenue
  - Interactive tooltips with company details
- **Function**: `create_revenue_comparison_bar()`

#### 2. Margin Comparison Chart
- **Data Source**: `companies.gross_margin`, `companies.operating_margin` (23 companies each)
- **Visualization**: Grouped horizontal bar chart
- **Features**:
  - Blue bars: Gross Margin %
  - Green bars: Operating Margin %
  - Shows top 15 companies by revenue
  - Side-by-side comparison of profitability metrics
- **Function**: `create_margin_comparison_chart()`

#### 3. Earnings Growth Distribution
- **Data Source**: `companies.earnings_growth` (12 companies with data)
- **Visualization**: Box plot by category
- **Features**:
  - Shows distribution quartiles
  - Individual data points visible
  - Grouped by EdTech category
  - Only displays companies with actual earnings_growth data
- **Function**: `create_earnings_growth_distribution()`

#### 4. Revenue by Category Treemap
- **Data Source**: `companies.revenue`, `companies.category`
- **Visualization**: Hierarchical treemap
- **Features**:
  - 2-level hierarchy: Market → Category → Companies
  - Size represents revenue
  - Color coded by category
  - Click to drill down
- **Function**: `create_revenue_by_category_treemap()`

### What Was Kept (Works with Real Data)
1. **Market Share Sunburst** - Uses aggregated category revenue totals ✅
2. **Performance Table** - Displays actual company data ✅
3. **KPI Cards** - Updated to use real metrics (revenue, margins, earnings growth count) ✅

## Data Availability Summary

| Metric | Companies with Data | Status |
|--------|---------------------|--------|
| Revenue | 23 / 23 | ✅ Complete |
| Gross Margin | 23 / 23 | ✅ Complete |
| Operating Margin | 23 / 23 | ✅ Complete |
| Earnings Growth | 12 / 23 | ⚠️ Partial |
| Revenue Growth YoY | 5 / 23 | ❌ Limited |
| MAU | 0 / 23 | ❌ None |
| ARPU | 0 / 23 | ❌ None |
| NRR | 0 / 23 | ❌ None (all mocked at 100) |

## File Changes

### Updated Files:
1. **`src/visualization/components.py`**
   - Added `create_revenue_comparison_bar()`
   - Added `create_margin_comparison_chart()`
   - Added `create_earnings_growth_distribution()`
   - Added `create_revenue_by_category_treemap()`
   - Retained existing functions for backward compatibility

2. **`src/visualization/dash_app_updated.py`** (NEW)
   - Complete rewrite with data-appropriate visualizations
   - Simplified layout with 4 main sections:
     1. Revenue analysis (bar chart + treemap)
     2. Margin & growth analysis
     3. Market share (sunburst)
     4. Performance table
   - Updated KPI cards to use real metrics
   - Removed callbacks for unavailable visualizations

### Original File Status:
- **`src/visualization/dash_app.py`** - Preserved for reference, contains old visualizations

## Dashboard Layout (New Structure)

```
1. Header + Data Freshness Alert
2. Filters (Category + Company Selection)
3. KPI Cards (4 metrics: Revenue, Gross Margin, Operating Margin, Earnings Growth Count)
4. Row 1: Revenue Visualizations
   - Revenue Comparison Bar (all 23 companies)
   - Revenue Treemap (hierarchical view)
5. Row 2: Profitability & Growth
   - Margin Comparison (top 15 by revenue)
   - Earnings Growth Distribution (12 companies with data)
6. Row 3: Market Share
   - Category Sunburst (aggregated view)
7. Row 4: Performance Table
   - Detailed company metrics
```

## To Deploy:

1. **Replace the old dashboard**:
   ```bash
   mv src/visualization/dash_app.py src/visualization/dash_app_old.py
   mv src/visualization/dash_app_updated.py src/visualization/dash_app.py
   ```

2. **Restart the dashboard**:
   ```bash
   python src/visualization/dash_app.py
   ```

3. **Access at**: http://localhost:8050

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Accuracy**: All visualizations use REAL data from database
2. **Transparency**: Users see exactly what data is available
3. **No Mock Data**: Removed all fake/simulated metrics
4. **Better UX**: Clear tooltips explaining data sources
5. **Maintainability**: Easy to add more charts as data becomes available

## Future Enhancements (When Data Available)

- Add retention curves when cohort data is collected
- Add competitive landscape scatter when more companies have YoY growth
- Add segment performance radar when additional metrics are ingested
- Implement time-series analysis when historical data accumulates

## Notes

- Earnings Growth chart automatically hides if no data available
- All charts handle missing data gracefully
- Column name mapping handles both old (`edtech_category`, `latest_revenue`) and new (`category`, `revenue`) schemas
- Dashboard works with both sync and async data sources
