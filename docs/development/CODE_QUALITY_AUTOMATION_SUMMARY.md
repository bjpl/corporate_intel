2. Run initial check: `pre-commit run --all-files`
3. Fix any issues identified
4. Commit changes

### Short-term (Team Adoption)
1. Update team documentation with new workflows
2. Conduct training session on pre-commit usage
3. Review and adjust thresholds based on team feedback
4. Monitor CI/CD pipeline performance

### Long-term (Continuous Improvement)
1. Regular pre-commit hook updates: `pre-commit autoupdate`
2. Increase coverage threshold gradually (target: 90%)
3. Add additional quality metrics (code duplication, etc.)
4. Integrate with code review tools

## Success Metrics

- ✅ **15 files** created/updated
- ✅ **10 pre-commit hooks** configured
- ✅ **80% coverage** threshold enforced
- ✅ **Strict type checking** enabled
- ✅ **3 comprehensive guides** documented
- ✅ **CI/CD pipeline** fully integrated
- ✅ **Multiple Python versions** tested (3.11, 3.12)
- ✅ **Security scanning** automated

## Quality Gates Enforced

1. **Pre-commit**: All hooks must pass before commit
2. **Type Checking**: mypy strict mode must pass
3. **Coverage**: 80% minimum threshold
4. **Tests**: All tests must pass
5. **Security**: No critical vulnerabilities
