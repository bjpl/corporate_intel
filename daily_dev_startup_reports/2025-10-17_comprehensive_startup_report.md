## [MANDATORY-GMS-3] UNCOMMITTED WORK ANALYSIS

### Git Status
```
M .claude-flow/metrics/performance.json
M .claude-flow/metrics/task-metrics.json
?? .test_venv/
```

### Analysis

**Modified Files** (2 files):
1. **.claude-flow/metrics/performance.json**
   - Category: Metrics/telemetry
   - Purpose: Claude Flow performance tracking
   - Status: Auto-generated metrics file
   - Action: Can be committed or left uncommitted (metrics file)

2. **.claude-flow/metrics/task-metrics.json**
   - Category: Metrics/telemetry
   - Purpose: Task execution metrics
   - Status: Auto-generated metrics file
   - Action: Can be committed or left uncommitted (metrics file)

**Untracked Files** (1 directory):
1. **.test_venv/**
   - Category: Virtual environment
   - Purpose: Test environment for local testing
   - Status: Should be in .gitignore
   - Action: Verify .gitignore contains `*.venv/` or `.test_venv/`

### Incomplete Work Assessment
✅ **No incomplete feature work detected**
- No uncommitted source code changes
- No staged changes waiting for commit
- Only metrics files (auto-generated, low priority)
- Virtual environment directory (should be ignored)

### Recommendation
1. ✅ **Metrics files**: Commit if desired for tracking, or leave uncommitted
2. ⚠️ **Test venv**: Ensure `.gitignore` includes `.test_venv/` to prevent future tracking
3. ✅ **Overall status**: Clean working tree with no blocking incomplete work

## [MANDATORY-GMS-4] ISSUE TRACKER REVIEW

### Issue Tracker Locations Identified

**Found**:
- `.claude/agents/github/issue-tracker.md` - GitHub issue tracking agent
- `.claude/commands/github/issue-tracker.md` - Issue tracker command
- `.claude/commands/github/issue-triage.md` - Issue triage command

**Analysis**: No formal issue tracking files (issues.md, JIRA references) found in repository. This suggests either:
1. Using external issue tracker (GitHub Issues online)
2. Using agent-based issue management
3. Small team with direct communication

- Container: `corporate-intel-staging-prometheus`
- Status: `Exited (127) 8 hours ago`
- Impact: Metrics collection offline
- Priority: Medium (staging environment only)
- Action: Investigate exit code 127 (command not found)

### Categorized Issues

**P0 (Critical - Blocking)**: None ✅

**P1 (High - Should Fix Soon)**:
1. Prometheus container failure (staging environment)
   - Effort: 1-2 hours (investigate + fix)
   - Blocking: Metrics/monitoring in staging

**P2 (Medium - Schedule This Sprint)**: None

**P3 (Low - Backlog)**: None

### Issue Tracker Health

- Well-defined daily tasks
- Measurable success criteria
- Low risk due to comprehensive preparation
- Existing automation reduces manual work

**7. Strategic Positioning** 🚀
- Establishes production baseline
- Enables performance monitoring with real data
- Validates architecture under real load
- Proves scalability incrementally
- Creates deployment cadence/rhythm

### Why Not the Other Plans

**Plan B (Advanced Features)**:
- ❌ Delays business value by 4 weeks
- ❌ Features not validated by real users
- ❌ Risk of building wrong features
- ❌ Technical debt already <5% - not critical
- ✅ Better done iteratively after production feedback

**Plan C (Performance Optimization)**:
- ❌ Premature optimization (no real load data)
- ❌ May optimize for wrong bottlenecks
- ❌ 4-week delay for uncertain benefit
- ❌ Current architecture already proven in staging
- ✅ Better done with production metrics

**Plan D (Technical Debt Deep Dive)**:
- ❌ Diminishing returns (debt already <5%)
- ❌ Current 9.5/10 score is excellent
- ❌ Perfectionism delays value
- ❌ 4-week delay not justified
- ✅ Better done incrementally

**Plan E (Hybrid)**:
- ❌ Split focus reduces effectiveness
- ❌ High coordination overhead
- ❌ Likely to compromise both production and features
- ❌ Requires larger team
- ✅ Could work with 3+ developers

### Success Looks Like

**Week 1 Outcomes**:
- ✅ Production environment deployed
- ✅ All services healthy (API, DB, Redis, MinIO, Prometheus, Grafana)
- ✅ Initial data ingested (SEC filings, market data)
- ✅ API responding with <100ms p99 latency
- ✅ Zero security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Monitoring dashboards active
- ✅ Automated backups running
- ✅ SSL certificates configured
- ✅ DNS pointing to production

**Week 2+ (Post-Production)**:
- 📊 Real performance metrics
- 👥 User feedback on actual usage
- 🐛 Production issues identified (if any)
- 🚀 Feature prioritization based on data
- 💡 Iterative improvements
- 📈 Value generation active

### Execution Strategy

**Daily Standups**: Track progress, identify blockers
**Quality Gates**: Don't proceed until tests pass
**Rollback Plan**: Automated rollback script ready
**Monitoring**: 24/7 monitoring from Day 1
**Communication**: Stakeholder updates at each milestone

### Risk Mitigation

**If Production Issues Occur**:
1. Automated rollback to previous version
2. Staging environment still operational for debugging
3. Comprehensive logs via OpenTelemetry
4. Error tracking via Sentry
5. Metrics via Prometheus for root cause analysis

**Contingency**: Maintain staging as fallback, can operate dual environments if needed
