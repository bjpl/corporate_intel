# Agent Operating Instructions - Corporate Intelligence Platform

**Purpose**: Universal behavioral and operational guidelines for all development work
**Scope**: Applies to all agents, all tasks, all sessions
**Priority**: MANDATORY compliance required - these are foundational principles

## 🎯 Relationship to Other Guidance

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  THIS FILE: MANDATORY Directives        │  ← HOW to operate professionally
│  Universal behavioral principles        │     (Quality, ethics, process)
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  SPARC_SETUP.md: Methodology            │  ← WHAT framework to follow
│  Development workflow & structure       │     (Phases, patterns, workflow)
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  QUICK_START.md: Technical Config       │  ← WHICH tools to use
│  Tools, commands, examples              │     (MCP, agents, commands)
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**These are complementary layers** - not conflicting rules:
- MANDATORY directives guide professional behavior
- SPARC provides development methodology
- Technical config specifies tools and setup

**If apparent conflict**: MANDATORY principles take precedence (quality, security, ethics are non-negotiable), but in practice they enhance rather than override SPARC/technical guidance.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# AGENT OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
# ALL DIRECTIVES ARE MANDATORY - STRICT COMPLIANCE
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## [MANDATORY-1] COMMUNICATION & TRANSPARENCY
→ Explain every action in detail as you perform it
→ Include: what you're doing, why, expected outcomes, context, and rationale
→ Maximize thought exposure: make reasoning visible and understandable

## [MANDATORY-2] PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION STYLE
→ Avoid sycophancy: Don't over-praise, over-agree, or use excessive enthusiasm
→ Maintain neutral, professional tone: Be direct, clear, and objective
→ Give honest assessments: Point out potential issues, trade-offs, and concerns
→ Don't over-apologize: Acknowledge errors once, then move forward with solutions
→ Challenge when appropriate: Question assumptions and suggest alternatives constructively
→ Skip unnecessary pleasantries: Get to the point efficiently
→ Be appropriately critical: Identify flaws, risks, and weaknesses without sugar-coating
→ Avoid hedging excessively: State things directly unless genuinely uncertain
→ No false validation: Don't agree with problematic ideas just to be agreeable
→ Professional candor over politeness: Prioritize clarity and usefulness over niceties

## [MANDATORY-3] VERSION CONTROL & DOCUMENTATION
→ Commit frequently to local and remote repositories
→ Write clear, meaningful commit messages for all changes

## [MANDATORY-4] TARGET AUDIENCE & SCOPE
→ Primary user: Individual use (requestor)
→ Future scope: Multi-user, public open-source or paid offering
→ Current priority: Build meaningful, functional features first

## [MANDATORY-5] CLARIFICATION PROTOCOL
→ Stop and ask questions when:
  • Instructions unclear or ambiguous
  • Uncertain about requirements or approach
  • Insufficient information for intelligent decisions
  • Multiple valid paths exist

## [MANDATORY-6] SWARM ORCHESTRATION
→ Topology: Use Claude Flow's MCP for agent topology and communication
→ Execution: Use Task tool per CLAUDE.md guidelines
→ Separation: Distinguish orchestration layer (Flow/MCP) from execution layer (Task tool)
→ See SPARC_SETUP.md for detailed coordination examples

## [MANDATORY-7] ERROR HANDLING & RESILIENCE
→ Implement graceful error handling with clear error messages
→ Log errors with context for debugging
→ Validate inputs and outputs at boundaries
→ Provide fallback strategies when operations fail
→ Never fail silently; always surface issues appropriately

## [MANDATORY-8] TESTING & QUALITY ASSURANCE
→ Write tests for critical functionality before considering work complete
→ Verify changes work as expected before committing
→ Document test cases and edge cases considered
→ Run existing tests to ensure no regressions
→ See SPARC_SETUP.md for TDD workflow details

## [MANDATORY-9] SECURITY & PRIVACY
→ Never commit secrets, API keys, or sensitive credentials
→ Use environment variables for configuration
→ Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks
→ Consider data privacy implications for future multi-user scenarios
→ Follow principle of least privilege

## [MANDATORY-10] ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN
→ Favor simple, readable solutions over clever complexity
→ Design for modularity and reusability from the start
→ Document architectural decisions and trade-offs
→ Consider future extensibility without over-engineering
→ Apply SOLID principles and appropriate design patterns

## [MANDATORY-11] INCREMENTAL DELIVERY
→ Break large tasks into small, deployable increments
→ Deliver working functionality frequently (daily if possible)
→ Each commit should leave the system in a working state
→ Prioritize MVP features over perfect implementations
→ Iterate based on feedback and learnings
→ Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
→ Never create files unless absolutely necessary for achieving your goal
→ Always prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one

## [MANDATORY-12] DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS
→ Update README.md as features are added
→ Document "why" decisions were made, not just "what"
→ Include setup instructions, dependencies, and usage examples
→ Maintain API documentation for all public interfaces
→ Document known limitations and future considerations
→ NEVER proactively create documentation files unless explicitly requested

## [MANDATORY-13] DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT
→ Minimize external dependencies; evaluate necessity
→ Pin dependency versions for reproducibility
→ Document why each major dependency was chosen
→ Regularly review and update dependencies for security

## [MANDATORY-14] PERFORMANCE AWARENESS
→ Profile before optimizing; avoid premature optimization
→ Consider scalability implications of design choices
→ Document performance characteristics and bottlenecks
→ Optimize for readability first, performance second (unless critical)

## [MANDATORY-15] STATE MANAGEMENT
→ Make state transitions explicit and traceable
→ Validate state consistency at critical points
→ Consider idempotency for operations that might retry
→ Document state machine behavior where applicable

## [MANDATORY-16] CONTINUOUS LEARNING & IMPROVEMENT
→ Document what worked and what didn't after completing tasks
→ Identify patterns in errors and user requests
→ Suggest process improvements based on observed inefficiencies
→ Build reusable solutions from recurring problems
→ Maintain a decision log for complex choices

## [MANDATORY-17] OBSERVABILITY & MONITORING
→ Log key operations with appropriate detail levels
→ Track performance metrics for critical operations
→ Implement health checks for system components
→ Make system state inspectable at any time
→ Alert on anomalies or degraded performance

## [MANDATORY-18] RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION
→ Track API calls, token usage, and computational costs
→ Implement caching strategies where appropriate
→ Avoid redundant operations and API calls
→ Consider rate limits and quota constraints
→ Optimize for cost-effectiveness without sacrificing quality

## [MANDATORY-19] USER EXPERIENCE
→ Prioritize clarity and usability in all interfaces
→ Provide helpful feedback for all operations
→ Design for accessibility from the start
→ Minimize cognitive load required to use features
→ Make error messages actionable and user-friendly

## [MANDATORY-20] DATA QUALITY & INTEGRITY
→ Validate data at system boundaries
→ Implement data consistency checks
