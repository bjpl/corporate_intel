# Bug Reports Directory

This directory contains all bug reports discovered during user testing.

## File Naming Convention

Bug reports should be named using the following format:
```
bug-YYYYMMDD-[short-description].md
```

**Examples:**
- `bug-20251024-password-validation.md`
- `bug-20251024-api-500-error.md`
- `bug-20251025-dashboard-loading.md`

## Bug ID Convention

Each bug should have a unique ID:
```
BUG-YYYYMMDD-##
```

**Examples:**
- `BUG-20251024-01` - First bug found on Oct 24, 2025
- `BUG-20251024-02` - Second bug found on Oct 24, 2025

## Creating a Bug Report

1. Copy the template from `../BUG_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md`
2. Create a new file in this directory with the naming convention above
3. Fill out all sections of the template
4. Save the file
5. Reference the bug in your testing notes

## Quick Create Command

```bash
# Create a new bug report
cp ../BUG_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md bugs/bug-$(date +%Y%m%d)-[description].md
```

## Bug Severity Levels

- **Critical**: App crashes, data loss, security vulnerability, system down
- **High**: Major feature broken, blocks workflows, no workaround
- **Medium**: Feature works but has issues, workaround available
- **Low**: Minor UI/UX issues, cosmetic problems, rare edge cases

## Bug Workflow

1. **Open**: Bug discovered and documented
2. **In Progress**: Bug is being investigated/fixed
3. **Fixed**: Fix has been applied
4. **Verified**: Fix has been tested and confirmed
5. **Closed**: Bug is resolved and closed
6. **Won't Fix**: Bug acknowledged but won't be fixed (with reason)

## Bug Tracking

Track all bugs in `../TESTING_NOTES.md` and reference them here.

Example:
```markdown
